# Task Management

With a user-friendly interface built using Angular, HTML and CSS, the application allows users to easily add tasks for themselves or for others and mark them as complete.

In this project, I utilized key Angular features like two-way data binding and directives, along with custom event handling to create an interactive experience. I also incorporated injectable services and interfaces to manage types more easily and keep the application logic organized.
